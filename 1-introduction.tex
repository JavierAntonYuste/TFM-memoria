\section{Context and motivation}
\label{sec:context}


%%https://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/revmedcoscen/rmc-2013/rmc133q.pdf
Eating Disorders (EDs) represent, according to the WHO~\cite{baldares2013trastornos}, the most important health problem of humankind, as the number of people affected is increasing, as well as the number of fatalities. They are mental illnesses with a slow recovery period that can become chronic or even lead to death. EDs are real and treatable problems, often occurring alongside other mental illnesses such as depression or substance abuse disorders.

These disorders are part of social and cultural phenomena that transcend the medical field into society. They are influenced by the ideal of beauty that the media disseminate, showing thinness as a symbol of independence and personal or professional success.

%-------------------Definition -------------------

Eating Disorders can be defined as \textit{a group of mental disorders that are driven by the development of behaviors aimed at weight control and an altered eating behaviour}~\cite{baldares2013trastornos}. This behavioural disturbance causes functioning problems on a physical and psychosocial level. The main characteristics of these diseases are extreme preoccupation with body and weight and disturbance of eating behaviours. The main representations are Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and others unspecified in which Binge Eating is included.

These psychological problems are context-sensitive as it greatly affects the development of these diseases in more vulnerable patients. An increase in these illnesses has been observed in recent years mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, the world entered a period of quarantine for several months. Confirmed cases and deaths caused by the virus increased rapidly and as a result of these reasons, the population experienced the development of psychological problems like anxiety, depression and stress~\cite{ramirez2021repercusiones}.

%The effects of the measures put in place to combat this pandemic have had a notable impact on mental health, increasing the development of inherent illnesses and psychological problems, such as Eating Disorders. 

The risk of suffering from one of these disorders has increased, with patients with no preexisting symptoms being able to develop one of these disorders under certain circumstances. This fact happens because emotional eating is related to biological, psychological and social factors, and the COVID-19 pandemic has been the perfect breeding ground for these types of problems to develop or grow worse~\cite{dos2022emotional}.

%Different studies have shed light on this situation and its importance, as people are having problems with the management of their emotions. It has an impact on population's well-being and in particular on what they eat. It is very important to raise awareness and implement measures to combat the side effects that this pandemic will have in the long term, as the longer it takes, the worse these problems will become~\cite{touyz2020eating}.

Experts comment the importance of raising awareness and implement measures to combat pandemic side effects~\cite{touyz2020eating}.These mentioned studies are not based on conjecture, but rather, through an exhaustive and quantitative analysis, as the ones performed in~\cite{j2022impact} or~\cite{vall2021impacto}. 

It has been shown that subjects suffering from an Eating Disorder have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation and, as a consequence, an increase in hospital admissions because of COVID-19. Specifically, it has been found that on average admissions have increased by 48\% compared to pre-pandemic times. In addition, it was found that 36\% of patients' symptoms increased, especially those related to anxiety and depression.

A major impact on the pandemic was discovered on young women between 14 and 35 years of age in the area of mental health problems. These results were shown in demographic studies carried out~\cite{vall2021impacto} which report severe or very severe levels of illness and symptoms. Namely, 30.8\% of the sample analysed suffered from depression, 25.4\% suffered from anxiety and 20.5\% from stress. Significant gender differences were found in terms of eating disorders, and it was found that some life events suffered by these people which generate stress are related to eating disorders.

The aforementioned work, proposes a model for analysing the psychological impact of confinement, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:vall_diagram}. It is possible to appreciate the negative correlation between psychological wellbeing and the symptomatologies that occur in mental illnesses. Furthermore, psychological wellbeing is also related to different factors including self-esteem, concern for appearance and self-care. These first two being the ones that have the greatest weight on wellbeing.

This Master Thesis has been developed on the topic of Mental Health and the relationship of this with technology and social networks. The aim to know how the use of these impacts wellness. 

%After an exhaustive literature review, it has been determined that there is a significant association between inappropriate and prolonged use of social networks and the effects of mental health, finding mainly anxious, depressive, stressful and compulsive patterns among others. Therefore, they have determined that social networks can lead to public health problems~\cite{pozo2022impacto}.

The importance of Eating Disorders after the pandemic has been understood, especially in young women today. Technology and in particular social networks, as a means of communication and expression, play a decisive role in the well-being of current society and particularly in the development of disorders.

Making use of these social networks, large amounts of information can be extracted and subsequently analysed, processed and used to improve the most critical part of these Eating Disorders, detection. The proposed system in this project will be used to help people to detect and analyse profiles of users potentially suffering from a disorder, in order to speed up the clinical diagnosis process, which is a key factor to take into account when treating a patient with this type of problem.

For implementing this system, we will use text classification techniques for analysing data coming from social networks. The obtained results will be presented in an engaging user interface easy and quick to use for the user to get a prediction as soon as possible.

\section{Project goals}
\label{sec:goals}
The goals of this Master Thesis have been defined from the beginning towards developing a social contribution that tackles one problem from the current society: Eating Disorders. With that in mind, the main goal of this project is to \textbf{develop a system for the analysis and detection of Eating Disorder-related mental health problems in social networks}. The application will integrate artificial intelligence technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to detect these problems working with user data extracted from social media. The purpose of this tool is the \textbf{detection and analysis of user publications referring to Eating Behavior Disorders on social networks}. For this, several sub tasks are required:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data collection, processing and analysis
    \item Design and implementation of machine learning models able to detect eating disorders from social media
    \item Training and evaluation the proposed models using the obtained datasets
    \item Development of a web application that integrates the proposed models for detecting and analyzing eating disorders
    \item System evaluation in a case study
    \item Integration of our system with a Task Automation Service (TAS) in order to enhance our system's features
\end{itemize}
